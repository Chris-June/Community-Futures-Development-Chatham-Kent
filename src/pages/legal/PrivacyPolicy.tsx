                Personal information is collected in order to assess the eligibility of the individual completing an application for financial assistance, as well as to report to Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) / Industry Canada. The individual is the main source of information but Community Futures Development Corporation of Chatham-Kent will also ask to obtain information directly from a third source where the individual does not have the required information.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Only that information which is required to make a determination of an individual's eligibility will be collected. Although the individual's Social Insurance Number may be requested in the application for confirming identification of the individual to the credit reporting agency, provision of this personal information is optional. The individual may provide alternative forms of identification, such as date of birth and driver's license number.

                By signing the application and/or other forms, implied consent is granted by the individual to obtain and/or to verify information from third parties such as banks, credit bureaus, other lenders, and insurance companies in the process of assessing the eligibility of an individual or client. Implied consent is also granted by the individual to permit Community Futures Development Corporation of Chatham-Kent to report or otherwise disclose information to Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) / Industry Canada, the federal department that administers the Ontario Community Futures Program.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
